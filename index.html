        <h1>Shape Royale Update Log</h1>
        <h2>Shape Royale Beta 1.0.0.0</h2>
        <p>This was the first update. It wasnt pretty, just a basic battle royale with no special effects. Each shape had sharp edges and pointy corners. Lots of bugs and just a hellhole, but that was what made it all begin!</p>
        <h2>Shape Royale Beta 1.0.0.1</h2>
        <p>This was the first update. It wasnt much different however, it did fix a lot of bugs like random crashes and unkillable enemys!</p>
        <h2>Shape Royale Beta 1.0.0.2</h2>
        <p>This was the second update. It was a very big one for the game as it came with trails, winnable games and many bug fixes. It also introduced the smooth shapes!</p>
        <h2>Shape Royale Beta 1.0.0.3</h2>
        <p>This update added a nice edition to the game, giving smooth gameplay, health upgrades and a bug free game!</p>
        <h2>Shape Royale Beta 1.0.0.4</h2>
        <p>This brings us the the current day! It is a beautifull update, bringing sound effects, cleaner trails, post processing and 3 new levels!</p>
